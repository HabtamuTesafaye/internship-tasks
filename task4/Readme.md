# Task 4: Complex Form Validation and Dynamic DOM Manipulation

This project enhances a registration page by implementing advanced form validation and dynamic updates to the DOM. The focus is on providing a user-friendly experience while ensuring that users input valid data before submission.

## Objective

The objective of this task is to extend form validation capabilities to include complex rules (such as password strength) and to implement dynamic updates to the DOM based on user interactions.

## Features

- **Complex Form Validation**: 
  - Implements advanced validation rules, including:
    - Required fields.
    - Email format validation.
    - Password strength requirements (minimum length, uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character).
    - Password confirmation validation.
  
- **Dynamic DOM Updates**: 
  - Real-time feedback on user input, including:
    - Immediate validation error messages.
    - Password strength indicators that update as the user types.

- **Client-Side Routing**: 
  - Smooth navigation to other parts of the application after successful registration.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router DOM**: For managing navigation and routing within the application.
- **JavaScript**: Used for implementing dynamic updates and validation logic.

## Steps Taken

1. **Enhance Form Validation**: 
   - Added complex validation rules to ensure user inputs meet specific criteria for registration.
   
2. **Dynamic DOM Manipulation**: 
   - Implemented JavaScript functions to update the UI in response to user interactions, providing real-time feedback on form validity.

3. **Implement Client-Side Routing**: 
   - Utilized React Router to enable navigation between different pages in the application, improving the overall user experience.

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Start the React application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
