# Profile Form with File Upload

## Purpose

This project creates a web application where users can fill out a profile form and optionally upload a photo. The application displays the submitted information and shows the uploaded photo as a small, circular image.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Markup language for structuring web content.
- **CSS**: Styling language for designing the layout and appearance.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language used on the server-side (Node.js) and for form handling.

## Packages Used

- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **EJS**: Templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML.
- **Multer**: Middleware for handling file uploads.

## Key Features

- **Profile Form**: Collects user details and supports file uploads.
- **File Upload Handling**: Uses Multer to manage file uploads with size limits.
- **Photo Styling**: Displays the uploaded photo in a circular, small format.

## What I Learned

- Setting up an Express server with EJS for rendering views.
- Handling file uploads using Multer and setting file size limits.
- Styling images with CSS for a circular and responsive design.
